# static6502

A static recompiler that converts MOS 6502 assembly to C code.

* This has been used to generate the core C file of the [cbmbasic](https://github.com/mist64/cbmbasic) project.
* It has morphed into [libcpu](https://github.com/libcpu/libcpu).

This project is old. It should not be used for anything. :)
